# Thoughts:

* Took me more time than I expected due to I was not working on my personal computer (Mac OS).

* This endpoint: /admin/best-profession: I didn't complete but the way I wanted to resolve it was to send timestamp dates and later parse them to "toISOString". In the endpoint, I let the start and end date work on the query.

* The last endpoint /admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer> I didnt complete but it's similar to the mentioned above. Execute a query using multiple joins.

* The code structure I had would like to use a service folder (I created but didn't use for time reasons).

* Finally, this challenge was funny and made me think fast to create and conceptualize the project idea
